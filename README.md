# ProjectMazeOnline
Goal: To create an engaging and fun maze game from scratch, while showcasing algorithms and latest technologies

# About
An online, multiplayer Maze Game built for competition and fun. Uses maven, springboot, node.js and react.js to develop and display and run this game.

# How to run
Make sure to have jvm and maven installed, then navigate to the project directory and run the command [mvn clean install package spring-boot:run]

# Details
I used several algorithms when developing this game. First I created a maze generation algorithm, basing it off of prims algorithm. Next I used a hash table and player wsad controls to create the movement and collisions. Finally I used a path finding algorithm to spawn the endpoint and make sure it was fair for both players. Most of my code was written in javascript, with some being written in java. I used springboot-sockets to create a websocket and make the game multiplayer and engaging. I hope you enjoy and take in all the hardwork that made this game a reality!
